## Usage

First start a local server. Note that opening `index.html` file directly doesn't work because of CORS policy.

```sh
python3 server.py
```

Open the browser and visit [http://localhost:8095/index.html?animation=independent_errors](http://localhost:8095/index.html?animation=independent_errors).

All the files under the root directory cal be loaded as an animation.
By default the animation works in a demo mode that plays the animation over and over again.
